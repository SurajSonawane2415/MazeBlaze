## About The Project
In this project, we will create a Line-following, Maze-solving bot which can find the shortest path in the given maze.

## Domains Explored
Control Systems, Embedded C, Graph algorithms, Electronics, PCB design.

## Project Workflow
- Learn to design PCB and understand the design of PCB used in MazeBlaze bot
- Implementing left follow rule
- Implementing path planing
- Implementing Dijsktra's Algorithm
- Implementing Flood Fill Algorithm
- 
## Demo

## File Structure

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
To download and use this code, the minimum requirements are:
- ESP_IDF
- Windows 7 or later (64-bit), Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Microsoft VS Code or any other IDE

### Installation
Clone the project by typing the following command in your Terminal/CommandPrompt:
      
     `git clone https://github.com/SurajSonawane2415/MazeBlaze`

Navigate to the MazeBlaze folder:
`cd MazeBlaze`

### Usage

Once the requirements are satisfied, you can easily download the project and use it on your machine. After following the above steps , use the following commands to:

To activate the IDF:
`get_idf`

To build the code:
`idf.py build`

To flash the code:
`idf.py -p (PORT) flash monitor`

## Future Work
- [ ] Implementing better algorithms like DFS/BFS.
- [ ] Achive higher speeds by increasing the efficiency of bot.
